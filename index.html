            <p class="lead">When I started programming everything was on the command line and felt a lot more straight forward.  
              This is a collection of command line text and numerousy games that all use the Python standard library (the tools 
            included by default when you download Python). Initial projects just use text, numbers, selection and iteration.  
            Subsequent projects will use the <em>curses</em> library for creating more advanced command line apps. Eventually I hope
            to add some simple <em>pygame</em> projects (not in the standard library.</p>

          <p class="lead">This Wagtail App is undergoing >>rapid>> development and help would be appreciated.  The goal is simple;
            <h3>"To creatre drop in Bootstrap Streamfield Blocks</h3>
            Having these blocks which can easily be added to a new site would help people get Wagtail sites filled with content 
            quickly after they are created.  Support for all the main Bootstrap elements would be included in as standard a way 
            as possible.

            This is the final project from <em>The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele</em>.  While I certainly recommend this course, I feel 
            that NodeJS really lacks a good content management system.  Therefore after this course I returned to Django development using Wagtail.

          <p>Rather than following the course exactly I implemented a more current version of Bootstrap.  A recurring them of my development journey
            has been completeing courses with more upto date libraries.
