Welcome to my Github account.  Here is an overview of my main fairly recent GitHub projects.  Like most programmers most of my code has been lost in the sands of time.

    <h1 class="display-4">Fun Coding Projects</h1>
    <p class="lead">When I started programming everything was on the command line and felt a lot more straight forward.  
      This is a collection of command line text and number based games that all use the Python standard library (the tools 
    included by default when you download Python). Initial projects just use text, numbers, selection and iteration.  
    Subsequent projects will use the <em>curses</em> library for creating more advanced command line apps. Eventually I hope
    to add some simple <em>pygame</em> projects (not in the standard library.</p>

  <p class="lead">Wagtool is a drop-in Streamfield Blocks app for Wagtail. This App is undergoing >>rapid>> development and help would be appreciated.  The goal is simple;
    These standard Bootstrap blocks which can easily be droppped into new Wagtail sites that use Bootstrap.  Will support all main Bootstrap elements.

  <h1 class="display-4">NodeJS Camping Website</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    This is the final project from <em>The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele</em>.  While I certainly recommend this course, I feel 
    that NodeJS really lacks a good content management system.  Therefore after this course I returned to Django development using Wagtail.

  <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm text-center" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/" role="button">Course on Udemy</a>
  <p class="lead">Rather than following the course exactly I implemented a more current version of Bootstrap.  A recurring them of my development journey
    has been completeing courses with more upto date libraries.
