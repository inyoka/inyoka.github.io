              This is a collection of command line text and numerousy games that all use the Python standard library (the tools 
            included by default when you download Python). Initial projects just use text, numbers, selection and iteration.  
            Subsequent projects will use the <em>curses</em> library for creating more advanced command line apps. Eventually I hope
            to add some simple <em>pygame</em> projects (not in the standard library.</p>

            This is the final project from <em>The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele</em>.  While I certainly recommend this course, I feel 
            that NodeJS really lacks a good content management system.  Therefore after this course I returned to Django development using Wagtail.

          <p>Rather than following the course exactly I implemented a more current version of Bootstrap.  A recurring them of my development journey
            has been completeing courses with more upto date libraries.
